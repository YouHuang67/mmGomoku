# mmGomoku

## Introduction

This repository presents an AI designed specifically for the game of Gomoku. The design philosophy and implementation of the AI is twofold:

1. **Core Engine**: Written in C++, it encompasses a search engine tailored for the basic Gomoku board patterns.
2. **High-Level AI**: This is constructed using Python and involves:
   - **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** algorithm, borrowed and adapted from the Alpha Go strategy.
   - A suitably adjusted neural network which aids in achieving higher intelligence in the game's decision-making.

Additionally, this repository is a refactor of the earlier project found here: [alpha_gomoku](https://github.com/YouHuang67/alpha_gomoku).
